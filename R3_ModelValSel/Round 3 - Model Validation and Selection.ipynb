    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "When applying machine learning to prediction problems, our main objective is to find a model that can accurately predict the label of data points for which it is yet unknown. To this end, we want to estimate a model's predictive capability on data points that have not been used for training the model. This is also frequently referred to as the **generalization capability**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous rounds, we established that ML models learn by searching for the predictor in the hypothesis space that minimizes the average loss on a set of **training data**. Also, we considered how to calculate the **training error** of a ML model, i.e., the error of the model on the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the training error is a poor proxy for what we wish to measure - the predictive performance on new and unlabeled data. Based on this observation, we are faced with two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can we better estimate the performance of a trained model on new and unlabeled data? Such estimates are needed to assess whether a ML model is suitable for practical use and to select the best model for deployment out of many alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is it possible to alter a ML model to learn a predictor function with good generalization capabilities? This is in contrast to learning the function that minimizes the average loss/training error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this round, you will find answers to both of these questions. We will first consider different **model validation** techniques for reliably estimating model performance on new data. Later, we will look at **regularization** techniques that enable ML models to learn predictor functions with better generalization capabilities by minimizing a penalized average loss during training."

    "## What is model validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation is the process of evaluating the predictive capability of a ML model on new data points. By using good model validation techniques, we can estimate the performance of a ML model with reasonable confidence prior to its use in practice. Before we dive into the details of model validation, we will briefly consider **overfitting** in order to show why model validation is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to predict a label $y$ of data points based on their features $\\mathbf{x}$. In order to do this, we choose a ML model and train it on a set of labelled data by minimizing the average loss of its predictions. A naive approach we might then take to estimate the performance of the trained model is to calculate its training error, which we assume to be equivalent to the average loss. Unfortunately, this approach is highly problematic and leads to overly optimistic estimates of the model's predictive capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training error is a poor estimate of a model's predictive performance because it is calculated on the same dataset that was used to train the model. Since this dataset only represents a small sample of all available data points, it is likely that a predictor that minimizes the average loss on the training set happens to fit this dataset particularly well. Consequently, the average loss on the training set will, in general, overestimate the performance of the model. This phenomenon is referred to as **overfitting**, because the trained model fits the training set overly well.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some degree of overfitting is typically present when applying a ML model to a prediction problem, it is a particularly significant issue when applying ML models with large hypothesis spaces that contain complex predictor functions (in relation to the size of the dataset). In such cases, a model that seemingly fits the data very well might turn out to perform very poorly on data points not in the training set. This kind of situation is exemplified in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../coursedata/R3_ModelValSel/overfitting.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure visualizes a dataset containing $m=20$ data points, along with two different predictor functions that were obtained by training two ML models on the four data points indicated by the orange crosses. The green predictor belongs to a standard linear regression model, while the red predictor belongs to a more complex, 4th degree polynomial model. The key observation regarding the predictors is that while the more complex model fits the data used for training very well, it has a much poorer fit on the rest of the data than the simpler linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the figure above seems like an extreme example due to miniscule number of data points in the training set, it nonetheless makes an important point. If we do not have the capacity to validate a model's performance on data points outside the training set, we will likely  overestimate the predictive capability of complex models due to overfitting. This sets us up for a great let-down when applying the models in practice. Furthermore, we will end up selecting overly complex models over simpler ones when choosing between many candidate models. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, it is worth emphasizing that the optimal complexity of the predictor function is generally dependent on the dataset's size. A deep neural network might generalize well when trained on a huge dataset, whereas even a linear model using many features might be prone to severe overfitting on a small dataset."

    "### Basic Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest scheme for validating the predictive performance of a ML model is to train the model on only some of the available labelled data, and use the rest to validate the performance of the trained model. Typically, the dataset used for training is referred to as the **training set**, and the data used for validation is referred to as the **validation set**. The image below visualizes a dataset split into a training and validation set.\n",

Assume that we have a dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ at our disposal, and that we wish to train a ML model that can predict the label $y$ of data points based on their features $\\mathbf{x}$. To be able to later validate the performance of the model, we will first split the dataset $\\mathbb{X}$ into a training set denoted by $\\mathbb{X}^{(t)}$ and a validation set denoted by $\\mathbb{X}^{(v)}$. The recommended size of the validation set is somewhat context dependent, but a common choice is 20-30% of the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "After splitting the dataset, we train our model on the training set by minimizing the average loss. Finally, we calculate the average prediction error on the validation set in order to estimate the performance of our model on new data points. The average prediction error on the validation set is referred to as the **validation error**. \n",

The following excerpt serves to refresh your memory on the problem formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The staff in your group have built a dataset containing features of 20 different neighborhoods. These features include the average number of rooms in the apartments, the percentage of buildings constructed before 1970 in the neighborhood, as well as eight experimental features designed by your colleagues in research. In addition, the fund's domain experts have valued a representative sample of apartments in each of the 20 neighborhoods and have arrived at a reliable estimate for the median apartment price in each one. This valuation has cost the fund a fortune, but the investment will pay off if your ML model can use this information to accurately predict the median apartment value of other neighborhoods at a negligible cost.*\n",
    "\n",

The data points in this problem are the different neighborhoods, and the label of these is the median apartment price. The features of the neighborhoods were already explicitly referred to in the previous paragraph. Still, it might be worth repeating that the features are properties belonging specifically to the data points.*\"\n"

However, this does not necessarily lead to better performance on new data. A complex model with too many features (large $r$) might only fit the training data very well, and generalize poorly to new data.\n",

    "In the figure, we can see that the validation error behaves very differently in comparison to the training error. The validation error obtains its minimum value at $r=2$ whereas the training error is monotonously decreasing with respect to $r$. It is clear that the training error is misleading as a measure of a model's performance on new data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the validation error in the figure above exposes the uselessness of the training error, the simple validation scheme we used is not perfect either. If the dataset used for training and validation is not very large, the amount of data points in the validation set might be insufficient for reliably describing the distribution of data points in general. Consequently, the average error on the validation set might not accurately reflect the performance of the model on new data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the validation error for $r=2$ is much lower than the training error in the figure above. Since ML models have a tendency to overfit the training set, the error on the validation set should not be lower than the training error if both sets accurately represent the distribution of the data. Therefore, we have a strong reason to believe that the validation set used in the task above just happens to fit the trained predictor for $r=2$ very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the reliability of the validation error can be easily improved by averaging multiple validation errors calculated using different training and validation sets. This approach is called $K$-fold cross-validation, and is presented next in more detail. "

    "## K-fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "When the amount of data available for training and validation is limited, there is a trade-off between overfitting the training set and the reliability of the validation error. On one hand, a smaller training set makes the models more prone to overfitting, but on the other, a smaller validation set leads to a less reliable estimate of the model's generalization capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can largely be avoided by using a more sophisticated validation method called **$K$-fold cross-validation**. In $K$-fold cross-validation, the data is first split into $K$ approximately equally sized subsets. Then, the subsets are used to calculate $K$ different estimates of the validation error, so that the $i$:th estimate is calculated using the $i$:th subset as the validation set and the remaining $K-1$ subsets as the training set. Finally, the $K$ estimates are averaged to obtain a final estimate of the validation error.\n",

    "If we compare the figure above to the one in the previous student task, we can see that the validation error obtained by 5-fold cross-validation seems to provide a more realistic estimate of the model's performance on new data. The validation error is now consistently larger than the training error, and the validation error seems less erratic. In practice, it is almost always preferable to use K-fold cross-validation instead of a single validation split for model validation and selection due to the increased robustness of the validation error.\n",

    "## Estimating the accuracy of the selected model on a separate test set\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use validation error to select the model with the best performance on new data out of many candidate models. In most applications, we are also interested in obtaining an estimate of the performance of the selected model on new data. To this end, it would seem convenient to use the validation error from the model selection phase, but unfortunately this generally results in an overly optimistic estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation error is, in general, an excessively optimistic estimate of the performance of the final model **since the model is chosen based on this value**. We can persuade ourselves of the validity of this statement by imagining two different models with a negligible difference in the expected error on new data points. **If we select one of these models based on the models' validation errors on a finite validation set, we will end up selecting the model that happens to fit the validation set better**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this is to use a separate dataset, frequently referred to as the **test set**, for testing the performance of the final model. In practice, the test set is most often obtained by selecting a part of the original dataset for this purpose. The rest of the data points are then used to train and validate the different model candidates using the methods described in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, it is good to emphasize that the separate test set is only necessary when we have selected a model based on the validation error. If we are only interested in obtaining the performance estimate for one model, a single validation/test set suffices."

    "##  Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we considered how to validate trained ML models to get high-quality estimates of their predictive capabilities. In the remainder of the notebook, we consider a tangential question - how to train an ML model so that the learned predictor generalizes better to new data than the predictor minimizing the average loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an ML method based on a large hypothesis space such as polynomials with a large degree. Large hypothesis spaces typically contain complex predictors that achieve very low training errors by overfitting the data. Thus, if we search for the optimal predictor in this hypothesis space (i.e., train the model) by minimizing the training error, we will obtain a predictor that overfits the training data and generalizes poorly to other data. However, there might be predictors in the hypothesis space that generalize much better to new data even though they have a higher average loss than the learned predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization** is a technique in which models are trained using by minimizing a **cost function** that penalizes the complexity of a predictor function $h$. The cost function that is minimized when training a regularized model is composed of the average loss and an additional **penalty term**:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The central idea of regularization is that the penalized cost function is minimized by a less complex predictor than the average loss. Thus, a model trained using the penalized cost function should, in general, have better generalization capabilities provided that the penalty term is well chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty term itself is composed of two factors - a **regularization term** $\\mathcal{R}(h)$ and a scaling factor $\\alpha$. The former quantifies a function's complexity, and the latter scales the penalty by a specified factor. Effectively, $\\alpha$ **offers a trade-off between the prediction error (training error) incurred on the training data and the complexity of a predictor**. Large $\\alpha$ favor less complex predictor functions, while small $\\alpha$ put more emphasis on obtaining a small average loss.\n",

    "The $\\alpha$ factor in the regularized cost function is a **hyperparameter** of the regularized model. In contrast to **model parameters**, hyperparameters are not optimized by training the model but must be defined in advance. The hyperparameters' values are typically chosen by selecting the value from a set of candidates that results in the lowest validation error for the trained model. This process is called **hyperparameter tuning** and can be seen as a case of model selection, in which the models differ by the values of the hyperparameters.\n",

    "1. we specify a list of candidate values for $\\alpha$, \n",
    "2. for each choice of $\\alpha$, we learn a predictor that minimizes the regularized cost function\n",
    "3. for each choice of $\\alpha$, we validate the trained predictor $h^{(\\alpha)}_{\\rm opt}$ by computing the validation error\n",

It also takes other optional parameters, such as the number of data splits `cv` in cross-validation.\n",
